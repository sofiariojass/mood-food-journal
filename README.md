# mood-food-journal
This is my final project for CS50. It is a command-line application that allows users to log the food they eat and the mood they experience afterward.

## Features
- Add new food/mood entries
- View past entries
- Store logs in a CSV file

## How to Run
In the terminal, run: python mood_food_journal.py

## Acknowledgments
structural help and suggestions from ChatGPT, but all code written and understood by me.
